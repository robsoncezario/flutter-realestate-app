# Flutter real estate app. This is a WIP

  - GraphQL
  - i18n
  - Provider
  - flutter-web (adaptive design)
  - Dark & light theme
  - It was fed with a graphQL API, using mongoDB and redis.
  - This project is highly dependent on geodata. The idea is a support for even multi currency with location related.
